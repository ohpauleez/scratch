Scratch
=======

This is a sandbox to:

* experiment with new technolgies, 
* play with ideas I've had, 
* and drop incomplete projects


GottaFind
---------

GottaFind is an anonymous location sharing application, built on HTML5 and Clojure.  
It makes use of:

* WebWorkers
* WebSockets
* HTML5 Geolocation
* Aleph - async web server
* Clojure's concurrency mechanisms


Plugin.py
---------

A simple experiment to create a lightweight plugin system in Python.


ShopDrop (to come)
---------

ShopDrop is a VERY simple shopping cart system, built with HTML5.  
It makes use of:

* LocalSession - to manage the state of the cart on the client side
* MicroData - to add semantic information to the items and users (http://www.data-vocabulary.org/)
