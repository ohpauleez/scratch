ExampleOne.java serves as a simple way for you to see how to get a ScriptingEngine
within Java6, set it up, call and run scripting, manage and manipulate the global
space of a ScriptingEngine, get values from the ScriptingEngine and from methods.
It uses ruby (jruby) as the example engine, but DetailedExample shows ruby, python,
and scheme.  Support for haskell also exists.  For more language support, examples,
or more information about jsr 223, look on the internet
