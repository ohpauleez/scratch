Scratch
=======

This is a sandbox to:
* experiment with new technolgies, 
* play with ideas I've had, 
* and drop incomplete projects


GottaFind
---------

GottaFind is an anonymous location sharing application, built on HTML5 and Clojure.  
It makes use of:

* WebWorkers
* WebSockets
* HTML5 Geolocation
* Aleph - async web server
* Clojure's concurrency mechanisms


Plugin.py
---------

A simple experiment to create a lightweight plugin system in Python.


P2PUsenet
---------
This was a project I did in college for my architecture class, 
a fully peer-to-peer version of a Usenet-like system.  
Documents in the project's `doc` directory walk through the architecture.
It features:

* P2P via JXTA
* A plugin system that supports multiple languages (Python, Ruby, Scheme, Haskell, Common Lisp, JavaScript)
* A C2 Event system implemented on top of Peers and SuperPeers.


ShopDrop (to come)
---------

ShopDrop is a VERY simple shopping cart system, built with HTML5.  
It makes use of:

* LocalSession - to manage the state of the cart on the client side
* MicroData - to add semantic information to the items and users (http://www.data-vocabulary.org/)
